</a>

    - Choose the option to **Import repo**

### **Development Environment**

The template uses **uv** to manage the Python environment 🐍. When you launch the project in Firebase Studio, `uv` will automatically create a **virtual environment** and install all the necessary packages for you, so you can start developing right away! 🚀

- source myenv/bin/activate
- cd agents

For every agent go to agent definition and rename **.env.template** to .env
Make sure to use your owe project etc. details in the env file

### **What are ADK Agents?**

ADK agents are **conversational AI agents** built using Google's App Development Kit 💬. They are designed to interact with users and perform various tasks, such as answering questions or performing actions. These examples will help you understand how to build and deploy your own agents. 💡
