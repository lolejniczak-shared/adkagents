# 🤖 ADK Agent Examples 

This repository contains various examples of **ADK (Agent Development Kit) agents** 🧑‍💻. These agents can be developed as a custom template within **Firebase Studio** 🚀.

---

### **Getting Started**

You have two simple ways to get started with this template:

1.  **Launch in Firebase Studio**: Click the "Open in IDX" launcher ➡️ on the repository page to automatically open it within **Firebase Studio**.

</a>


2.  **Manual Import**: 
    - Go to **[Firebase Studio](https://studio.firebase.google.com/)**
    - Choose the option to **Import repo**
    - Paste this repository's URL and click **Import** 📂

### **Development Environment**

The template uses **uv** to manage the Python environment 🐍. When you launch the project in Firebase Studio, **uv** will automatically create a **virtual environment** and install all the necessary packages for you, so you can start developing right away! 🚀

- activate the virtual environment: source .venv/bin/activate
- cd agents
- For every agent go to agent definition and rename **.env.template** to **.env** and make sure to use your own project etc. details in the .env file

### **What are ADK Agents?**

ADK agents are **AI agents** built using [Google's Agent Development Kit](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) 💬. They are designed to interact with users and perform various tasks, such as answering questions or performing actions. These examples will help you understand how to build and deploy your own agents. 💡
